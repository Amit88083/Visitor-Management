We have develop android-based GUI enabled real-time visitor management system for IIITA campus.

Description: The system should be able to register the visitor’s check-in by recording his/her personal details like name, phone number, 
e-mail id, etc., and then the issue pass is generated for the visitor which will also be shared on the email. 
The issue pass must highlight the issue ID, check-in date and time, purpose of visit, period of stay, etc. Finally at the time of check-out,
the visitor must provide the issued pass to register the end of visitor’s entry.
